I dont know how to make it so the images arent stretched out on desktop view.
I never managed to fix that but I think all the requirments are met I did get some help from Heinry to make the first image in the thumbnail container be 'clicked' as soon as the page loads.
The requiremnt I found easiest was the alt tags I found the accesibility difficult that took me some time to do. Figuring out the tab and enter and left and right keys to navigate through the thumbnails. remembering to add a css feature so its noticable.
